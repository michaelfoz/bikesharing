# MCD Module 14: bikesharing

The purpose of this assignment/challenge is to get familiar with Tableau, a tool used for creating visuals.  Tableau is helpful in that little-to no code is written.  Tableau allows the developer to show clientel or co-workers--who do not necessarily code--visuals that are effective/concise and aesthetically pleasing.
